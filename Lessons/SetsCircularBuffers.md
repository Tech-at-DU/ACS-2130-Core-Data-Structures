# Sets & Circular Buffers

## Learning Objectives

By this end of this lesson, students should be able to...

1. Explain what a set is and what some variations of a set are, such as a multiset
1. Explain other types of queues such as a circular buffer
1. Practice implementing more abstract data types backed by a data structure of their choice

## Topics
- Abstract data types: [set], [multiset (bag)][multiset]
- Concrete data structures: [hash table], [circular buffer (circular queue, ring buffer)][circular buffer]
- [Set operations]

## Resources
- Read Vaidehi Joshi's [article on sets and their use in databases][BaseCS sets] with beautiful drawings and excellent examples

## Challenges
- Implement `Set` class (abstract data type backed by data structure of your choice) with the following [set operations] as instance methods and properties:
    - `__init__(elements=None)` - initialize a new empty set structure, and add each element if a sequence is given
    - `size` - property that tracks the number of elements in constant time
    - `contains(element)` - return a boolean indicating whether `element` is in this set
    - `add(element)` - add `element` to this set, if not present already
    - `remove(element)` - remove `element` from this set, if present, or else raise `KeyError`
    - `union(other_set)` - return a new set that is the union of this set and `other_set`
    - `intersection(other_set)` - return a new set that is the intersection of this set and `other_set`
    - `difference(other_set)` - return a new set that is the difference of this set and `other_set`
    - `is_subset(other_set)` - return a boolean indicating whether `other_set` is a subset of this set
- Write unit tests to ensure the `Set` class is robust
    - Include test cases for each class instance method
- Annotate all instance methods with complexity analysis of running time and space (memory)
- Compare the behaviors of your `Set` class to those of the [Python `set` type] and [Swift `Set` type]

## Stretch Challenges
- Implement `CircularBuffer` class (backed by dynamic array) with the following instance methods and properties:
    - `__init__(max_size)` - initialize a new circular buffer that can store at most `max_size` items
    - `size` - property that tracks the number of items in the buffer
    - `is_empty` - check if the buffer is empty
    - `is_full` - check if the buffer is full
    - `enqueue(item)` - insert `item` at the back of the buffer
    - `front` - return the item at the front of the buffer
    - `dequeue` - remove and return the item at the front of the buffer
- Annotate `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods with running time complexity analysis
- Write unit tests to ensure the `CircularBuffer` class is robust
    - Include test cases for each class instance method and property
- Annotate `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods with running time complexity analysis

## TT - Sets (20 min)

A **Set** is an abstract data type. It is an unordered collection (just like a map) but it only has individual items (no key/value pairs). We call these items **elements**

**Example Use Case**: find if a student is in a class (is this particular student element in the set or not)

But what if we want to know if a student is in two classes? We can use a set operation called **intersection**. Think of an intersection as like using an `and` operator. The below **Venn Diagram** illustrates this intersection:

![venn_intersect](./Assets/venn_intersect.png)

[Venn diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram) are going to be super helpful for understanding sets.

### Set Operations

![venn-operations](./Assets/venn_operations.png)

There are other operations we can use to compare multiple sets:

- **Union** - consists of all elements in sets. Think of a union as like using an `or` operator
- **Symmetric Difference** - Items are in one set or the other, but not both. Think of a symmetric difference as like using an `exclusive or` (`XOR`)
    - `symmetric difference = union - intersection`

All of these methods can be used in [python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set), [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) too!

### Set Terminology

- **Subset** - one set is _contained_ within the other
- **Superset** - opposite of a subset, one set is _containing_ another set (or multiple)
- **Disjoint** - two sets that don't share any elements at all
- **`frozenSet`** - an immutable set in python. It can only be created once, and then can no longer be edited, unlike a regular set where you can add/delete from it at any time

### Implementing Sets

Sets are _not_ hashable, but _elements we put in the sets can be hashable_

- We would do this if we want to look up an element using its hashcode!

Therefore, we could use a **hashtable** to implement a set. However, we could also use arrays, or linked lists if you don't need elements to be hashable.

## Set Worksheet (Part 1)

Implement Set using each of these four data structures:
- LinkedList
- Dynamic Array
- Sorted Array
- Hash Table

### LinkedList:
    - add : implementation: append or prepend, time: `O(1) + O(n) = O(n)`
            - NOTE: must call contains first since set is unique - so runtime is `O(1)` for add only but `O(n)` for contains
    - remove : implementation: traverse and delete, time: `O(n)`
    - contains: implementation: travers and find, time: `O(n)`

### Dynamic Array
    - add: implementation: loop over to check if present, if not, append at end time: `O(n)`
    - remove: implementation: loop over and if found, remove time: `O(n)`
    - contains: implementation: loop over using linear search time: `O(n)`
        - Note: The `in` keyword in Python is linear search


### Sorted Array
    - add: implementation: binary search to find, insert by shifting down time: binary search `O(log n)` + shift `O(n)` = `O(n)`
    - _Think about it... _
        - Why is `O(log n) + O(n) = O(n)`? Draw a graph of each note how much `log n` contributes to the overall graph as `n` gets large, vs how much `n` contributes.
    - remove: implementation: binary search and remove via shift time: `O(n)`
    - contains: implementation: binary search time: `O(log n)`

### Hash Table
    - refresh your understanding of hash tables:
        - `n` = #entries
        - `b` = #buckets
        - `l` = load factor = n/b = average size of linked list in each bucket
        - in a resizable hash table (optimized) we can assume `l` is a small constant so `O(1)`
        - in an non resizable hash table, `l` is not constant, so it contributes `O(l)`
- Refresh you memory of Linear Probing and Chaining and how these work with load factor.     [ Link to Load Factor Slide ]
    -add: implementation: store element as key using .set method time:  `O(1)`
        - Consider the following code:  `hash_table.set(element,element)`
            - What does this do in Python?
                - its a touple which stores `(key, value)` pairs not as values but as pointers so if the same value is sent for the key and value then each pointer will point to the same place. This reduces the memory usage.
        - In dynamic languages like Python, and others - we often are working with pointers, not values.
    -remove: implementation:  hash to find bucket and delete on linked list in the bucket time: `O(1)`
    -contains: implementation: hash to find bucket and traverse linked list in the bucket time: `O(1)`

## Set Worksheet (Part 2)
- Before you begin, note that in Part 1, we learned that the Hash Table implementation of Set is the fastest.  So, when you need to implement a set for the operations in Part 2, use a Hash Table.
- Note: these operations below use two sets so assume Set 1 has size `n`, Set 2 has size `m` and then complexity will be stated in terms of `n` and 'm'. EX: `O(nm)`.

### Union
    - Hints:
        - Using `__iter__` allows you to use an object in for loop
        - Using `yeild` - returns an item without exiting the function.

### Intersection:
    - Note: Draw a picture to visualize two overlapping sets and write code to  optimize code by looping through smaller set not larger set (since both contain the intersection)
    - Intersection relies on contains and add methods `O(min(m,n))`


- Difference
    - Convention for the method `difference(self, other_set)` is to return everything in `self` that is not in the intersection.
    - Cannot optimize by looping over smaller set, have to loop over set that is the first argument
    - Complexity `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the first set - independent of the size of the other set.


## For Homework

- Read the [set theory article](https://medium.com/basecs/set-theory-the-method-to-database-madness-5ec4b4f05d79) (also linked in resources)
- Do the `Set` challenges (should have at least `contains`, `add`, `remove`, and one of the methods that use a `set` as an input by next class)
- Write unit tests for your challenges (write the first few before you begin the challenges)
    - Review past unit tests for previous challenges to see how to write them
