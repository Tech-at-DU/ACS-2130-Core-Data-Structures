## Topics
- Compare [abstract data types] and [concrete data structures][data structures]
- Abstract data types: [list]
- Concrete data structures: [array], [dynamic array (resizable array, vector)][dynamic array], [linked list]

## Learning Outcomes (5 min)

By this end of this lesson, students should be able to...

1. Practice more advanced techniques with lists and arrays
1. Implement list manipulation methods such as insert and replace

## Resources
- Review Make School's [array and linked list slides]
- Watch Make School's [array and linked list video lecture]
- Read Vaidehi Joshi's [articles on linked lists, part 1: how they work][BaseCS linked list 1] and [part 2: complexity analysis and comparison to arrays][BaseCS linked list 2] with excellent, beautiful drawings
- Watch HackerRank's [linked list video]
- Watch Harvard's [array video], [singly linked list video], and [doubly linked list video]
- Play with VisuAlgo's [interactive linked list visualization][visualgo list]

## Challenges
- Add new features to `LinkedList` class using [linked list starter code]:
    - Add `size` property that tracks list length in constant running time
    - Implement `get_at_index(index)` - returns the item at `index` in the list
    - Implement `insert_at_index(index, item)` - inserts `item` at `index` (all items after `index` are moved down)
    - Implement `replace(old_item, new_item)` - replaces `old_item` in the list with `new_item` using the same node
    - Run `python linkedlist.py` to test `LinkedList` class instance methods on a small example
    - Run `pytest linkedlist_test.py` to run the [linked list unit tests] and fix any failures
- Annotate methods with complexity analysis of running time and space (memory)

## Stretch Challenges
- Implement `DoublyLinkedList` class with `BinaryNode` objects, which have both `next` and `previous` properties
- Write unit tests for to ensure the `DoublyLinkedList` class is robust
    - Include test cases for each class instance method and property
- Annotate methods with complexity analysis of running time and space (memory)

## Progress Tracker (3 min)

- Fill out attendance, challenges completed, etc.

## Arrays and Linked Lists (5 min)

- Differences between Linked List and Array
    - can access arbitrary address of array in constant time - so can find middle element with binary search.
    - In Linked List, you can't access the middle directly (have to traverse from beginning) so binary search would not work.
- Similarity between Array and Linked List?
    - they both are ordered
    - both implements methods: insert, append, prepend, read
- List Abstract Data Type - ADT
    - Arrays and Linked List are concrete Data Structures that can implement the ADT / Interface / Protocol

#### Preview of Challenges for next class (20 min):
Implement methods on linked list class so interface is the same as an array. [On repo - includes example, unit tests, starter code]
